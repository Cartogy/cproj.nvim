# Cproj

What is Cproj?
* Cproj is a neovim plugin that facilitates development of large C/C++ projects.
* Its aim is to be as simple as possible, but providing the core development tools at the tip of your fingertips.

What Cproj is not.
* It is not meant for small, single-directory projects. These projects, the *make* command would suffices.
* It is not meant to replace plugins such as *vimspector* or *dap*.
